Hello, there! I’m Thamara come from Brazil. I was born in 17/01/1991. Was researcher at Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.

Started programming as desktop developer, from Pascal until C#. Now, in process to be full stack developer. Learning design, mobile and web at the same time. Creating app's, mockup's, and web app's. I like to use Node js, phonegap, cordova, angular, ionic, firebase, mongodb. 

Enjoy seeing <a href="../projects/index.html"><strong>Projects</strong></a> (my creations, children, toys...haha). I love challenges. Always doing the "best possible". Fixing my own errors.
