<p> Hello, guys! This is my first post here. I intend to write just in English. I arrived from Canada a week. Now, I will keep practicing English in my life. </p>

<p> So, I’m gonna use this blog to write things I did in Canada, my experience, my intentions, and what I’m learning, my doubts, anyway keep two or one posts a week. </p>
